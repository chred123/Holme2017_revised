  Abstract                 = {We have developed a new technique in which a solid reagent, cobalt(III) fluoride, is used to prepare oxygen gas for isotope ratio measurement from water derived either from direct injection or from the pyrolysis of solid samples. The technique uses continuous flow, isotope ratio monitoring, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (irmGC/ MS) to measure the delta(18)O and delta(17)O of the oxygen gas. Water from appropriate samples is evolved by a procedure of stepped pyrolysis (0-1000 degreesC, typically in 50 degreesC increments) under a flowing stream of helium carrier gas. The method has considerable advantages over others used for water analysis in that it is quick; requires only small samples, typically 1-50 mg of whole rock samples (corresponding to similar to0.2 mumol of H2O); and the reagent is easy and safe to handle. Reproducibility in isotope ratio measurement obtained from pyrolysis of samples of a terrestrial solid standard are delta(18)O +/- 0.54, delta(17)O +/- 0.33, and Delta(17)O +/- 0.10parts per thousand, 1sigma in all cases. The technique was developed primarily for the analysis of meteorites, and the efficiency of the method is illustrated herein by results from water standards, solid reference materials, and a sample of the Murchison CM2 meteorite.},

  Abstract                 = {We have determined the isotope effects of O-17 and O-18 substitution of O-16 in H2O on molecular diffusivities of water vapor in air by the use of evaporation experiments. The derived diffusion fractionation coefficients (17)alpha(diff) and (18)alpha(diff) are 1.0146 +/- 0.0002 and 1.0283 +/- 0.0003, respectively. We also determined, for the first time, the ratio In((17)alpha(diff))/In((18)alpha(diff)) as 0.5185 +/- 0.0002. This ratio, which is in excellent agreement with the theoretical value of 0.5184, is significantly smaller than the ratio in vapor-liquid equilibrium (0.529). We show how this new experimental information gives rise to O-17 excess in meteoric water, and how it can be applied in isotope hydrology. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

A pyrolysis furnace packed;vith nickel, on which carbon is deposited as required, is shown to give efficient conversion of nanomole quantities of sample material to H-2 and CO. A water trap and postpyrolysis gas chromatograph separate analyte gases from traces of H2O and CO2. The isotope ratio mass spectrometer used gives adequate separation of (HH+)-H-2-H-1 and He-4(+) to allow use of He as carrier gas. The pyrolysis technique provides a rapid method for analysis of water with a precision of +/-2 parts per thousand for delta(2)H and +/-0.3 parts per thousand for delta(18)O. Similar precisions are obtained for injections of 0.5 mu L of urine and volatile organic compounds. Memory between samples is <2% for both delta(2)H and delta(18)O measurement. The technique is accurate over a wide range of enrichment for both delta(2)H and delta(18)O and is suitable for use in natural abundance and tracer studies of liquid samples.},

Existing atmospheric monitors based on non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) sensors have known problems - they are non-linear, sensitive to water vapor concentration, and susceptible to drift. Many cannot easily be simultaneously calibrated across different sites to the level of accuracy required for use in atmospheric studies. We present results from field trials by Pennsylvania State University and the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of a newly available analyzer, based on cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS), capable of measuring the concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) and water vapor (H2O). In addition, we present data from a new analyzer which measures CO2, methane (CH4), and H2O.},

  Abstract                 = {We calibrate the delta(18)O paleothermometer for central Greenland using borehole temperatures, a thermal model forced by a measured delta(18)O record and a formal inverse technique. The calibration is determined mostly by temperature fluctuations of the last several centuries, including the Little Ice Age. Results are generally insensitive to model variables, including initial condition, basal boundary condition, parameterization of snow thermal properties, ice thickness and likely errors in temperature and isotope measurements. Results of this borehole calibration also seem to be in agreement with modern spatial gradients of delta(18)O and temperature. We suggest that calibrations of isotopic paleothermometers using borehole temperatures are a useful paleoclimate tool, because they are independent of spatial gradients and include the effects of prehistoric temperatures over Ice sheets.},

The reproducibility is about 1 parts per thousand, The accuracy of this method is confirmed by analysis of IAEA standard waters VSMOW, GISP, and SLAP. All aqueous samples including liquid food samples as well as methane gas were injected as original compounds and directly measured without any preparation.},

  Abstract                 = {A new technique for on-line high resolution isotopic analysis of liquid water, tailored for ice core studies is presented. We built an interface between a Wavelength Scanned Cavity Ring Down Spectrometer (WS-CRDS) purchased from Picarro Inc. and a Continuous Flow Analysis (CFA) system. The system offers the possibility to perform simultaneuous water isotopic analysis of delta(18)O and delta D on a continuous stream of liquid water as generated from a continuously melted ice rod. Injection of sub mu l amounts of liquid water is achieved by pumping sample through a fused silica capillary and instantaneously vaporizing it with 100% efficiency in a home made oven at a temperature of 170 degrees C. A calibration procedure allows for proper reporting of the data on the VSMOW-SLAP scale. We apply the necessary corrections based on the assessed performance of the system regarding instrumental drifts and dependance on the water concentration in the optical cavity. The melt rates are monitored in order to assign a depth scale to the measured isotopic profiles. Application of spectral methods yields the combined uncertainty of the system at below 0.1% and 0.5 parts per thousand for delta(18)O and delta D, respectively. This performance is comparable to that achieved with mass spectrometry. Dispersion of the sample in the transfer lines limits the temporal resolution of the technique. In this work we investigate and assess these dispersion effects. By using an optimal filtering method we show how the measured profiles can be corrected for the smoothing effects resulting from the sample dispersion. Considering the significant advantages the technique offers, i.e. simultaneuous measurement of delta(18)O and delta D, potentially in combination with chemical components that are traditionally measured on CFA systems, notable reduction on analysis time and power consumption, we consider it as an alternative to traditional isotope ratio mass spectrometry with the possibility to be deployed for field ice core studies. We present data acquired in the field during the 2010 season as part of the NEEM deep ice core drilling project in North Greenland.},

  Abstract                 = {New continuous on- line techniques for water and air extracted from ice cores are developed. Water isotope ratio determination on any of the water phases ( water vapour, water, ice) is of great relevance in different research fields, such as climate and paleoclimate studies, geological surveys, and hydrological studies. The conventional techniques for water isotopes are available in different layouts but all of them are rather time- consuming. Here we report new fast on- line techniques that process water as well as ice samples. The analysis time is only similar to 5 min per sample which includes equilibration and processing. Measurement precision and accuracy are better than 0.1 parts per thousand and 1 parts per thousand for delta(18)O and delta D, respectively, comparable to conventional techniques. The new on- line techniques are able to analyze a wide range of aqueous samples. This allows, for the first time, to make continuous isotope measurements on ice cores. Similarly, continuous and fast analysis of aqueous samples can be of great value for hydrological, geological and perhaps medical applications. Furthermore, a new technique for the on- line analysis of air isotopes extracted from ice cores is developed. This technique allows rapid analyses with high resolution of the main air components nitrogen, oxygen, and argon. Measurement precision is comparable to precisions obtained by conventional techniques. It is now possible to measure delta(15)N and delta(18)O(atm) over entire ice cores helping to synchronize chronologies, to assess gas age - ice age differences, and to calibrate the paleothermometry for rapid temperature changes. This new on- line air extraction and analyzing technique complements the water methods in an ideal way as it separates the air from the melt- water of an ice sample. The remaining water waste flux can directly be analyzed by the water methods.},

  Abstract                 = {Well-documented present-day distributions of stable water isotopes (HDO and (H2O)-O-18) show the existence, in middle and high latitudes, of a linear relationship between the mean annual isotope content of precipitation (delta D and delta(18)O) and the mean annual temperature at the precipitation site. Paleoclimatologists have used this relationship, which is particularly well obeyed over Greenland and Antarctica, to infer paleotemperatures from ice core data. There is, however, growing evidence that spatial and temporal isotope/ surface temperature slopes differ, thus complicating the use of stable water isotopes as paleothermometers. In this paper we review empirical estimates of temporal slopes in polar regions and relevant information that can be inferred from isotope models: simple, Rayleigh-type distillation models and (particularly over Greenland) general circulation models (GCMs) fitted with isotope tracer diagnostics. Empirical estimates of temporal slopes appear consistently lower than present-day spatial slopes and are dependent on the timescale considered. This difference is most probably due to changes in the evaporative origins of moisture, changes in the seasonality of the precipitation, changes in the strength of the inversion layer, or some combination of these changes. Isotope models have not yet been used to evaluate the relative influences of these different factors. The apparent disagreement in the temporal and spatial slopes clearly makes calibrating the isotope paleothermometer difficult. Nevertheless, the use of a (calibrated) isotope paleothermometer appears justified; empirical estimates and most (though not all) GCM results support the practice of interpreting ice core isotope records in terms of local temperature changes.},

  Abstract                 = {Experimental measurements of bulk diffusion in ice and surface diffusion on ice were performed using laser resonant desorption (LRD) techniques. Bulk diffusion in ice was examined using ice sandwich structures and continuous source experiments together with LRD depth-profiling analysis. Surface diffusion was monitored using prepare-refill-probe LRD experiments. New experimental results were obtained for the bulk diffusion of NH3 and CH3OH. These species probably exist as hydrates in the ice. The LRD measurements for CH3OH hydrate diffusion, combined with previous results, provide evidence for a vacancy-mediated diffusion mechanism. The diffusion rates for NH3 hydrates are much larger than diffusion rates for H2O self-diffusion in ice and are attributed to the disruption of the ice lattice. LRD prepare-refill-probe experiments revealed that surface diffusion was not measurable for almost all of the species examined on ice. Only butane displayed a measurable surface mobility that was attributed to its unique size and chemical nature. These new measurements of bulk diffusion in ice and surface diffusion on ice should be useful in developing our understanding of kinetic processes in and on ice that are relevant to heterogeneous atmospheric chemistry and ice core analysis.},

The single-crystal hexagonal ice multilayers were grown epitaxially on a Ru(001) metal substrate, and the diffusion coefficients were measured perpendicular to the basal (0001) facet. The measured HDO diffusion coefficients ranged from D = (2.2 +/- 0.3) x 10(-16) to D = (3.9 +/- 0.4) x 10(-14) cm(2)/s over the temperature range 153-170 K. Arrhenius analysis of the temperature-dependent diffusion coefficients yielded a diffusion activation energy of E-A = 17.0 +/- 1.0 kcal/mol and a preexponential factor of D-0 = (4.2 +/- 0.8) x 10(8) cm(2)/s. The similarity of the diffusion coefficients for HDO and (H2O)-O-18 indicates that H/D exchange does not contribute significantly to HDO diffusion in ice. The agreement between the diffusion kinetics for HDO and (H2O)-O-18 argues that the HDO diffusion occurs via a molecular transport mechanism. The large diffusion preexponentials for both HDO and (H2O)-O-18 diffusion into the ultrathin ice multilayers also suggest that built transport properties in ice may be perturbed by close proximity to the ice surface.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a new system to measure the relative isotopic abundances of both rare isotopes of oxygen in water. Using electrolysis with CuSO4 as electrolyte, water is transformed into oxygen gas. This gas is subsequently analyzed with a standard Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer. We investigated the features of the system in detail. The results for delta(17)O and delta(18)O are carefully calibrated against delta(18)O of VSMOW using our "conventional" H2O-CO2 equilibrium system. For the electrolysis system, we obtain an accuracy (including calibration) of 0.10 parts per thousand for delta(18)O, and 0.07 parts per thousand for delta(17)O. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness and accuracy of the system by analyzing a large set of natural waters (both fresh and salt waters). We establish the O-17 and O-18 relation to be of the type: 1 + delta(17)O = (1 + delta(18)O)(lambda), and find lambda to be 0.5281 +/- 0.0015. We conclude that the O-17 fractionation in water appears to be completely analogous to that of O-18. Still, measurements concerning the equilibrium and kinetic fractionation of the evaporation process are needed. The new method is an excellent alternative to the traditional H2O-CO2 equilibrium method. Moreover, its capability to also measure O-17 may be fruitfully exploited, e.g., in biomedical studies extending the doubly labelled water technique, or in studies of stratospheric water.},

  Abstract                 = {Two deep ice cores from central Greenland, drilled in the 1990s, have played a key role in climate reconstructions of the Northern Hemisphere, but the oldest sections of the cores were disturbed in chronology owing to ice folding near the bedrock. Here we present an undisturbed climate record from a North Greenland ice core, which extends back to 123,000 years before the present, within the last interglacial period. The oxygen isotopes in the ice imply that climate was stable during the last interglacial period, with temperatures 5 degreesC warmer than today. We find unexpectedly large temperature differences between our new record from northern Greenland and the undisturbed sections of the cores from central Greenland, suggesting that the extent of ice in the Northern Hemisphere modulated the latitudinal temperature gradients in Greenland. This record shows a slow decline in temperatures that marked the initiation of the last glacial period. Our record reveals a hitherto unrecognized warm period initiated by an abrupt climate warming about 115,000 years ago, before glacial conditions were fully developed. This event does not appear to have an immediate Antarctic counterpart, suggesting that the climate see-saw between the hemispheres (which dominated the last glacial period) was not operating at this time.},

Understanding the mechanism of this termination requires that the precise relative timing of abrupt climate warming in the tropics versus the North Atlantic be known. Nitrogen and argon isotopes in trapped air in Greenland ice show that the Greenland Summit warmed 9 +/- 3 degrees C over a period of several decades, beginning 14,672 years ago. Atmospheric methane concentrations rose abruptly over a similar to 50-year period and began their increase 20 to 30 years after the onset of the abrupt Greenland warming. These data suggest that tropical climate became warmer or wetter (or both) similar to 20 to 80 years after the onset of Greenland warming, supporting a North Atlantic rather than a tropical trigger for the climate event.},

This warming coincides with the onset of a prominent rise in atmospheric methane concentration, indicating that the climate change was synchronous (within a few decades) over a region of at least hemispheric extent, and providing constraints on previously proposed mechanisms of climate change at this time, The depth of the nitrogen-isotope signal relative to the depth of the climate change recorded in the Ice matrix indicates that, during the Younger Dryas, the summit of Greenland was 15 +/- 3 degrees C colder than today.},

  Abstract                 = {An automated inlet system has been developed for deuterium/hydrogen isotope analysis of water using on-line reduction to hydrogen. A modified HPLC autosampler introduces precise aliquots of water (0.5 to 5 mu l) into a heated expansion chamber which is connected via a capillary to hot uranium where the water is reduced to uranium oxide, and hydrogen for analysis. The 600 degrees C uranium reduction furnace is kept at analyzer pressure in the mass spectrometer, which maximizes the lifetime of the reductant to handle more than 4000 injections per 0.5 g of depleted uranium. This is a flow-through system, and unlike zinc or catalyst methods, some 'memory' effects are encountered, requiring two injections to obtain a delta(D) precision of less than +/-1%, and four injections far a precision of less than +/-0.5%. Sample preparation is limited to pipetting water into an autosampler vial. The computer-controlled system provides extended unattended operation allowing, for instance, large runs of samples that can occupy the instrument over entire weekends. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.
