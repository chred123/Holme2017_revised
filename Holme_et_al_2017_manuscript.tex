\begin{abstract}
Polar precipitation archived in ice caps contains information on past temperature conditions. 
Such information can be retrieved by measuring the water isotopic signals of \delOx~and \delD~in ice cores. 
These signals have been attenuated during densification due to molecular diffusion in the firn column, 
where the magnitude of the diffusion is isotopologoue specific and temperature dependent. 
By utilizing the differential diffusion signal, dual isotope measurements of \delOx~and \delD~enable multiple 
temperature reconstruction techniques. This study assesses how well six different methods can be used to 
reconstruct past surface temperatures from the diffusion-based temperature proxies. Two of the methods are 
based on the single diffusion lengths of \delOx~and \delD, three of the methods employ the differential diffusion signal, 
while the last uses the ratio between the single diffusion lengths. All techniques are tested on synthetic data 
in order to evaluate their accuracy and precision. 
In addition, a benchmark test is applied to thirteen high resolution data sets 
from Greenland and Antarctica, which represent a broad range of mean annual surface temperatures and accumulation rates. 
The presented methods are found to accurately reconstruct the temperatures of the synthetic data, 
and the estimated temperatures are shown to be unbiased. Both the benchmark test and the synthetic data test demonstrate 
that the most precise reconstructions are obtained when using the single isotope diffusion lengths, with precisions around $1.0\,^\mathrm{o}\mathrm{C}$. 
In the benchmark test, the single isotope diffusion lengths are also found to reconstruct consistent temperatures with a 
root-mean-square-deviation of $0.7\,^\mathrm{o}\mathrm{C}$. The techniques employing the differential diffusion signals are more uncertain, 
where the most precise method has a precision of $1.9\,^\mathrm{o}\mathrm{C}$. 
The diffusion length ratio method is the least precise with a precision of $13.7\,^\mathrm{o}\mathrm{C}$. 
The absolute temperature estimates from this method are also shown to be highly sensitive to the choice of fractionation factor parameterization. 
From the combined analyses of the water isotope diffusion methods of the synthetic data and ice core data, this study demonstrates that methods 
based on the single isotope diffusion lengths result in the most accurate and precise estimates of past temperatures.

\section{Introduction} %% \introduction[modified heading if necessary]
\label{Intro}
Polar precipitation stored for thousands of years in the ice caps of Greenland and Antarctica
contains unique information on past climatic conditions. The isotopic composition 
of polar ice  commonly expressed
through the $\delta$ notation
has been shown to work as a direct proxy of the relative depletion of a water vapor mass in its 
journey from the evaporation site to the place where condensation takes place \citep{Epstein1951, IAEA}. 
Additionally, for modern times, it shows a good correlation with the temperature of the cloud at the
time of precipitation \citep{Dansgaard2, Dansgaard} and as a result it has been proposed and used 
as a proxy of past temperatures \citep{Jouzel1984, Jouzel1997, Johnsen2001}. 


The use of the isotopic paleothermometer presents some notable limitations.
The constant linear relationship between \delOx~and temperature commonly referred to as the ``spatial slope''
may hold for present conditions, 
but studies based on borehole temperature reconstruction \citep{Cuffey1994, JOHNSEN1995a} 
as well as the thermal fractionation of the \delN~signal in polar firn 
\citep{Severinghaus1998, Severinghaus1999} have
independently underlined the inaccuracy of the spatial isotope slope when it is extrapolated to past climatic 
conditions. 
Even though qualitatively the \delOx~signal comprises past temperature information, it fails
to provide a quantitative picture on the magnitudes of past climatic changes.

\cite{Johnsen1977, WhillansGrootes1985} and \cite{Johnsen2000} set the foundations for the quantitative description 
of the diffusive processes the water isotopic signal undergoes in the porous firn layer from the time
of deposition until pore close--off. Even though the main purpose of \cite{Johnsen2000} was to investigate
how to reconstruct the part of the signal that was attenuated during the diffusive processes, the authors
make a clear reference to the possibility of using the assessment of the diffusive rates as a proxy for
past firn temperatures. 

The temperature reconstruction method based on isotope firn diffusion requires 
data of high resolution. Moreover, if one would like to look into the differential diffusion signal, 
datasets of both \delOx~and \delD~are required. Such data sets have until recently not been easy to
obtain especially due to the challenging nature of the \delD~analysis \citep{BIGELEISEN1952, Vaughn1998}.
With the advent of present 	commercial high--accuracy, high--precision Infra-Red spectrometers 
\citep{Crosson2008, Brand2009}, simultaneous measurements of \delOx~and \delD~have become 
easier to obtain. Coupling of these instruments to Continuous Flow Analysis systems \citep{Gkinis2011, Emanuelsson2015,Jones2017a} 
can also result in measurements of ultra--high resolution, a necessary condition for 
accurate temperature reconstructions based on water isotope diffusion.

A number of existing works have presented past firn temperature reconstructions
based on water isotope diffusion. \cite{Simonsen2011} and \cite{Gkinis2014} used high resolution 
isotopic datasets from the NorthGRIP ice core \citep{NGRIPmembers2004}. The first study makes use
of the differential diffusion signal, utilizing spectral estimates of high--resolution 
dual  \delOx~and \delD~datasets covering
the GS--1 and GI--1 periods in the NorthGRIP ice core \citep{Rasmussen2014}. 
The second study 
presents a combined temperature and accumulation history of the past 16,000 years based on the 
power spectral density (\textbf{PSD} hereafter) signals of 
high resolution \delOx~measurements of the NorthGRIP ice core. More recently, \cite{vanderWel2015a}
introduced a slightly different approach for reconstructing the differential diffusion signal and testing it
on dual \delOx, \delD~high resolution data from the EDML ice core \citep{Oerter2004}. 
By artificially forward--diffusing the \delD~signal the authors estimate differential diffusion rates
by maximizing the correlation between the \delOx~and \delD~signal.  

In this work we attempt to look into all different varieties of temperature diffusion
reconstruction techniques and assess their performance. 
We use synthetic, as well as real ice core data sets that represent 
Holocene conditions from a variety of drilling sites on Greenland and Antarctica.
Our objective is to use data sections that originate from parts of the core as close to present day 
as possible. By doing this we aim to minimize possible uncertainties and biases in the ice flow thinning
adjustment that is required for temperature interpretation of the diffusion rate estimates.
Such a bias has been shown to exist for the NorthGRIP ice core \citep{Gkinis2014}, most likely 
due to the \cite{DJmodel} ice flow model overestimating  the past accumulation rates for the site. 
In order to include as much data as possible, approximately half of the datasets used here
have an age of 9-10 ka. This age coincides with the timing of the early Holocene Climate Optimum around 5-9 ka (\textbf{HCO} hereafter). 
For Greenlandic drill sites, temperatures were up to $3 \,^\mathrm{o}$C warmer than present day during the HCO \citep{Dorthe1998}.
Another aspect of this study is that it uses water isotopic data sets of \delOx~and 
\delD~measured using different analytical techniques, namely Isotope Ratio Mass Spectroscopy 
(\textbf{IRMS} hereafter) as  well as Cavity Ring Down Spectroscopy (\textbf{CRDS} hereafter).
Two of the data sets presented here were obtained using Continuous Flow Analysis (\textbf{CFA} hereafter)
systems tailored for water isotopic analysis \citep{Gkinis2011}. All data sections are characterized by
a very high sampling resolution typically of $5\, \mathrm{cm}$ or better.

\section{Diffusion of water isotope signals in firn}

The main focus of this section is to outline 
the various temperature reconstruction techniques that can be employed for 
paleotemperature reconstructions.
The fundamentals of isotope diffusion theory are also presented. In order to avoid
significant overlap  with previously published works
e.g. \citet{Johnsen1977, Johnsen2000, Simonsen2011, Gkinis2014, vanderWel2015a} 
we occasionally  point the reader to any of the latter
or/and refer to specific sections in the Appendix.
We exemplify and illustrate the use of various techniques using synthetic data prepared such 
that they resemble  two representative regimes of ice coring sites on the Greenland summit and the 
East Antarctic Plateau. \\

The porous medium of the top $60-80\, \mathrm{m}$ of firn allows for a molecular diffusion process that attenuates
the water isotope signal from the time of deposition until  pore close--off. 
The process takes place in the vapor phase and it can be described by Fick's second law as
(assuming that the water isotope ratio signal ($\delta$) approximates the concentration):
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \delta}{\partial t} = D \left( t \right) \frac{\partial^2 \delta}{\partial z^2} - 
\dot{\varepsilon}_z \left( t \right) z ~\frac{\partial \delta}{\partial z} \enspace 
\label{eq.diffusion}
\end{equation}
where $D \left( t \right)$ is the diffusivity coefficient, $\dot{\varepsilon}_z\left(t\right)$
the vertical strain rate and  $z$ is the vertical axis of a coordinate system, 
with its origin being fixed within the considered layer.
The attenuation of the isotopic signal results in loss of information.
However the dependence of $\dot{\varepsilon}_z\left(t\right)$  and $D \left( t \right)$ 
on temperature and accumulation presents the possibility of using the process as a tool
to infer these two paleoclimatic parameters. A solution to Eq. \ref{eq.diffusion} can be given by
the convolution of the initial isotopic profile $\delta'$ with a Gaussian filter $\mathcal{G}$ as:
\begin{equation}
\delta \left( z\right) = \mathcal{S} \left( z \right) \left[ \delta ' \left( z \right) 
\ast \mathcal{G} \left( z \right) \right]
\label{eq.convolution}
\end{equation}
where the Gaussian filter is described as:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{G}\left(z \right) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} \, e^{\frac{-z^2}{2 \sigma^2}} \enspace ,
\label{eq.gaussian}
\end{equation}
and $\mathcal{S}$ is the total thinning of the layer at depth $z$ described by
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{S} \left( z \right) = e^{\int_0^{z} \dot{\varepsilon}_z \left( z' \right) \mathrm{d}z'} \enspace .
\label{eq.thinning}
\end{equation}
In Eq. \ref{eq.gaussian}, the standard deviation term $\sigma^2$ represents the average 
displacement of a water molecule along the z--axis and is commonly referred to as the diffusion length.
The $\sigma^2$ quantity is a direct measure of diffusion and its accurate estimate is critical
to any attempt of reconstructing temperatures that are based on the isotope diffusion thermometer.  
The diffusion length is directly related to the diffusivity coefficient and the strain rate 
(as the strain rate is approximately proportional to the densification rate in the firn column)
and it can therefore be regarded as a measure of firn temperature as well as accumulation rate.


The differential equation describing the evolution of $\sigma^2$ with time is 
given by \citep{Johnsen1977}: 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\mathrm{d}\sigma^2}{\mathrm{d}t} - 2\,\dot{\varepsilon}_z\!\left( t \right) \sigma^2 = 
2D\!\left( t \right) \enspace .
\label{eq.diflength}
\end{equation}
In the case of firn the following approximation can be made for the strain rate:
\begin{equation}
\dot{\varepsilon}_z \left(
	t \right) \approx -\frac{\mathrm{d\rho}}{\,\,\,\mathrm{d t}}\,\frac{\,1\,}{\,\rho\,},
\label{eq.strainrate}
\end{equation}
with $\rho$ representing the density.
Then for the firn column, Eq. \ref{eq.diflength} can be solved hereby yielding a solution for $\sigma^2$:
\begin{equation}
\sigma^2 \left( \rho \right) = \frac{\,1\,}{\rho^2}\int_{\rho_o}^{\rho}2\rho^2 
{\left( \frac{\mathrm{d}\rho}{\mathrm{d}t}\right)}^{-1}\! D \!\left( \rho \right) \,\mathrm{d}\rho , 
\label{eq.difflengthintegration}
\end{equation}
where  $\rho_o$ is the surface density. 
Under the assumption that the diffusivity coefficient $D\left(\rho\right)$ and the
densification rate   $\frac{\mathrm{d}\rho}{\mathrm{d}t}$ are known,
integration from surface density $\rho_o$ to the close--off density $\rho_{co}$
can be performed yielding a model based estimate for the diffusion length.
In this work we make use of the Herron--Langway densification model (\textbf{H--L hereafter})
and the diffusivity rate parametrization introduced by \cite{Johnsen2000} (see Appendix \ref{sec:appendix_firn_diffusion}).
$\frac{\mathrm{d}\rho}{\mathrm{d}t}$ depends on temperature and overburden pressure
and $D\left(\rho\right)$ depends on temperature and firn connectivity.
The dependence of the diffusion length on temperature
and accumulation provide the basis for the use of firn diffusion as a proxy of temperature 
or accumulation. In order to reconstruct the temperature, the accumulation rate is assumed
known and vice versa.

In the firn diffusion model, a seasonal temperature signal that propagates down in the firn is included (see Appendix \ref{sec:firn_temp_profile}).
The seasonal temperature variation affects the firn diffusion length nonlinearly in the upper $10-12 \, \mathrm{m}$ due to the saturation vapor pressure's exponential
dependence on temperature.
%The difference between a diffusion model with a constant firn temperature profile and having a seasonal temperature variation is seen in Fig. \ref{fig:firn_diffusion_model}.
%Including a seasonal cycle in the firn diffusion model corrects a bias in the diffusion model of $0.1\,\mathrm{cm}$.

In Fig. \ref{fig:diffusion_length_profiles} we evaluate Eq. \ref{eq.difflengthintegration} for all three isotopic ratios 
of water (\delOx, \delOxb, \delD) using boundary conditions characteristic of ice core sites from central Greenland
and the East Antarctic Ice Cap.
We acknowledge that high resolution measurements of \delOxb~currently are unavailable, 
but synthetic \delOxb~signals have been evaluated in order to demonstrate its potential as a diffusion-based temperature proxy.
In Fig. \ref{fig:diffusion_length_profiles},
the transition between zone 1 and zone 2 densification (at the critical density $\rho_\mathrm{c} = 550\, \mathrm{kg m}^{-3}$) is 
evident as a kink in both the densification and diffusion model.
For the first case we consider cold and dry conditions (case \textbf{A} hereafter)
representative of Antarctic ice coring sites
(e.g. Dome C, Vostok) with a surface temperature $T_{\mathrm{sur}} = -55 \,^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and 
annual accumulation $A = 0.032 \;\mathrm{myr^{-1}\, ice\, eq.}$
For the second case we consider relatively warm and humid conditions (case \textbf{B} hereafter)
representative of central Greenlandic ice coring sites
(e.g. GISP2, GRIP, NorthGRIP) with a surface temperature $T_{\mathrm{sur}} = -29 \,^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and 
annual accumulation $A = 0.22 \;\mathrm{myr^{-1}\, ice\, eq.}$
In this study, drill sites that have a vast amount of melt layers have been excluded. 
Melt layers will stop the mixing between the air in the firn and the surrounding atmosphere earlier than the natural densification process. 
This will result in a small diffusion length. 
While perfoming temperature reconstructions, the small diffusion length will falsely result in a low temperature even though the climate was warm.
It is therefore difficult to get an accurate estimate of the firn diffusion length if the drill sites have too warm surface temperatures.

\section{Isotope diffusion in the solid phase}
\label{ice_diffusion_section}
Below the close-off depth, diffusion occurs in solid ice driven by the isotopic
gradients within the lattice of the ice crystals. 
This process is orders of magnitude slower than firn diffusion.
Several studies exist that deal with the estimate of the diffusivity 
coefficient in ice \citep{Itagaki1964, Blicks1966, Delibaltas1966, Ramseier1967, Livingston1997}.
The differences resulting from the various diffusivity coefficients are small and certainly
negligible for the case of our study where the influence of solid ice diffusion is practically negligible.
As done before by other similar firn diffusion studies \citep{Johnsen2000, Simonsen2011, Gkinis2014}
we make use of the parametrization given in \cite{Ramseier1967} as:
\begin{equation}
D_{\mathrm{ice}} = 9.2 \cdot 10^{-4} \cdot \exp \left(- \frac{7186}{T} \right) \mathrm{ m^2 s^{-1}} . 
\label{eq.icediffusivity}
\end{equation}
Assuming that a depth--age scale as well as a thinning function are available for the 
ice core a solution for the ice diffusion length is given by (see Appendix \ref{sec:appendix_ice_diffusion} for details):
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{\mathrm{ice}}^2 \!\left( t' \right) = 
S\! \left( t' \right)^2 \,\int_0^{t'} 2 D_{\mathrm{ice}} \!\left( t \right) S \!\left( t \right) ^{-2} \,\mathrm{d} t.
\label{eq.icediffusion}
\end{equation}
In Fig. \ref{fig:ice_diffusion_multi} we have calculated ice diffusion lengths for four different cores (NGRIP, NEEM, Dome C, EDML).
For the calculation of the diffusivities we have used high precision measurements of 
borehole temperature profiles and assumed a steady state condition. 
As it can be seen, for the low temperature/low accumulation sites of Dome C and EDML, $\sigma_{\mathrm{ice}}$
is lower. As the temperature of the ice increases closer to the bedrock $\sigma_{\mathrm{ice}}$ increases monotonically.
For the special case of the Dome C core (with a bottom age exceeding 800,000 years), $\sigma_{\mathrm{ice}}$
reaches values as high as 15 $\mathrm{cm}$.

\section{Reconstructing firn temperatures}  \label{sec:methods}
\subsection{The single isotopologue diffusion}\label{sec:single_diffusion}

The simplest implementation of the water isotope diffusion thermometer focuses on the
assessment of the diffusion rates of one isotopologue in firn.
Implementation of Eq. \ref{eq.difflengthintegration}, yields diffusion length values 
from surface to close--off and below with ice thinning disregarded for now. 


A fundamental property of the convolution operation is that it is equivalent to  multiplication
 in the frequency domain. The transfer function for the diffusion process will be given by the
Fourier transform of the Gaussian filter that will itself be a Gaussian function described by 
\citep{Abramowitz1964, Gkinis2014}:
\begin{equation}
\label{ftrans_gaussian}
\mathfrak{F}
[ \mathcal{G} (z) ] =
\hat{\mathcal{G}} = {e}^{\frac{-k^2 \sigma^2}{2}} {} \enspace .
\end{equation}%e10
In Eq. \ref{ftrans_gaussian}, $k = 2\pi / \lambda$ where $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the 
isotopic time series. 
In Fig. \ref{fig:transfer_function} we illustrate the effect of the diffusion transfer function on a range of wavelengths
for $\sigma = 1,\, 2,\, 4\; \mathrm{and} \;8 \;	\mathrm{cm.}$ 
Wavelengths on the order of $50\,\mathrm{cm}$ and above remain largely unaltered while signals with 
wavelengths shorter than $20\,\mathrm{cm}$ are heavily attenuated. 


An estimate of the diffusion length $\sigma$ can be obtained by looking at the power spectrum of the diffused 
isotopic time series. Assuming a total noise signal $\eta \left( k \right)$
apparent in the time series, a model describing the power spectrum is given by: 
\begin{equation}
P_s =    P_0(k) {e}^{-k^2 \sigma^2} + {\vert \hat{\eta} \left( k \right) \vert} ^{2}. 
\label{eq:powerspectrum}
\end{equation}
$P_0(k)$ is the spectral density of the compressed profile without diffusion. 
It is assumed independent of $k$ (now $P_0$) due to the strong depositional noise 
encountered in high resolution $\delta$ ice core series \citep{Johnsen2000}. 
Moreover, \cite{Gkinis2014} showed that the redness of the climate signal does not significantly affect the 
estimated diffusion lengths.
The noise signal is generally described well by autoregression of order 1 (AR-1),
and its power spectral density is defined as \citep{Kay1981}:
\begin{equation}
|\hat{\eta}(k )|^2 = \frac{\sigma_{\mathrm{\eta}}^2 \Delta}
 {\left| 1-a_1 \exp{\left( -i k  \Delta \right) } \right|^2} {},
\end{equation}
where $a_1$ is the AR-1 coefficient, $\sigma_{\mathrm{\eta}}^2$ is the variance of the noise signal 
and $\Delta$ is the sample size.
The noise model combines the post depositional and measurement induced noise.

In Fig. \ref{fig:synthetic_power_spectra}, an example of power spectra based on a synthetic time series is shown. 
A description of how the synthetic time series is generated is provided in Appendix \ref{sec:appendix_synthetic}.
This time series have been applied a diffusion length of  $8.40 \, \mathrm{cm}$.
The spectral estimate of the time series $\mathbb{P}_s$ 
is calculated using Burg's spectral estimation method
\citep{Kay1981} and specifically the algorithm presented in \cite{Andersen1974}. 
Using a least--squares approach we optimize the fit of the model $P_s$ to the data series $\mathbb{P}_s$ by varying the four 
parameters $P_0$, $\sigma$, $a_1$ and $\sigma_{\mathrm{\eta}}^2$.
In the case of Fig. \ref{fig:synthetic_power_spectra},
the $\vert P_s - \mathbb{P}_s \vert^2$ least squares optimization resulted in 
$P_0=0.35\,\permil^2\cdot \mathrm{m}$, $\sigma = 8.45 \, \mathrm{cm}$, $a_1 = 0.05$ and $\sigma_{\mathrm{\eta}}^2 =0.005 \, \permil^2$.


Assuming a diffusion length $\widehat{\sigma}_i^2$ is obtained for depth $z_i$ by means of 
$\vert P_s - \mathbb{P}_s \vert^2$ minimization, one can calculate the equivalent diffusion 
length at the bottom of the firn column $\sigma^2_{\mathrm{firn}}$ in order to estimate firn temperatures
by means of Eq. \ref{eq.difflengthintegration}. 
In order to do this, one needs to take into account three necessary corrections
- (1) sampling diffusion, (2) ice diffusion and (3) thinning. 
The first concerns the artifactually imposed
diffusion due to the sampling of the ice core. 
In the case of a discrete sampling scheme with resolution $\Delta$ the additional 
diffusion length is (see Appendix \ref{sec:appendix_sampling_diffusion}): 
\begin{equation}
\sigma^2_{\mathrm{dis}} = \frac{2\Delta^2}{\pi^2}\ln{\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)}.
\label{sampling_sigma}
\end{equation}
In the case of high resolution measurements carried out with CFA measurement systems, there
exist a number of ways to characterize the sampling diffusion length. 
Typically the step or impulse response of the CFA system can be measured yielding a Gaussian 
filter specific for the CFA system \citep{Gkinis2011, Emanuelsson2015, Jones2017a}. 
The Gaussian filter can be characterized by a diffusion 
length $\sigma^2_{\mathrm{cfa}}$ that can be directly used to perform a sampling correction.
The second correction concerns the ice diffusion as described in Sec. \ref{ice_diffusion_section}.
The quantities $\sigma^2_{\mathrm{ice}}$ and $\sigma^2_{\mathrm{dis}}$ can be subtracted from 
$\widehat{\sigma}_i^2$ yielding a scaled value   of $\sigma^2_{\mathrm{firn}}$ due to ice flow thinning.
As a result,  we can finally obtain $\sigma^2_{\mathrm{firn}}$ as:
\begin{equation} 
\sigma^2_\text{firn} = \frac{\widehat{\sigma}_i^2 - \sigma^2_\text{dis} - \sigma^2_\text{ice}}{{\mathcal{S}(z)}^{2}}.
\label{eq.firn_data}
\end{equation}

The $\sigma^2_{\mathrm{firn}}$ estimate is the cumulated diffusion that the signal has experienced. 
It is therefore only possible to obtain the integrated firn column temperature. 
This is done by calculating the root of the equation (for a known $A(z)$):
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:T_reconstruction}
\left(\frac{\rho_{co}}{\rho_i} \right)^2  \sigma^2(\rho = \rho_{\mathrm{co}},T(z), A(z)) - \sigma^2_\text{firn} = 0 
\end{equation}
where $\sigma^2$ is the result of the integration in Eq. \ref{eq.difflengthintegration} from surface to 
close--off density ($\rho_o  \rightarrow \rho_{\mathrm{co}}$). In this work we use a Newton-Raphson numerical scheme 
\citep{RECIPES} for the calculation of the roots of the equation.


While reconstructing temperatures, each input parameter to Eq. \ref{eq:T_reconstruction} 
($A$, $\rho_{co}$, $\rho_o$, surface pressure $P$, $\mathcal{S}$ and $\sigma_{ice}$) is drawn from a Gaussian distribution with a predefined uncertainty (Table \ref{tbl:model_unc}).
This resembles uncertainties in the densification process, diffusion quantities and their parameterizations and inaccuracies in the 
ice flow thinning model.
Moreover, this facilitates a better comparison between the single and differential diffusion techniques (Sec. \ref{sec:diff_diffusion}) 
if one of the reconstruction methods is more sensitive to such uncertainties.
The uncertainties might be lower for a specific ice core as an input parameter e.g. $A$ can be well constrained from other climate proxies.
This would decrease the uncertainty and hereby increase the precision of the temperature reconstructions.


\begin{table}[H]
	\center
	\caption{The standard deviations of the input parameters. 
		Most of the standard deviations are expressed as a percentage of the mean input value.}
	\label{tbl:model_unc}
	\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c } 
		\toprule
		Parameter & $A$  & $\rho_{co}$  & $\rho_o$  & $P$  & $\mathcal{S}$ & $\sigma_{ice}$ \\
		\midrule
		Uncertainty &	$\pm 5 \% A_\mathrm{mean} $  &  $\pm20 \, \mathrm{kg m^{-3}}$  &  $\pm30 \, \mathrm{kg m^{-3}}$   &    $\pm 2 \% P_\mathrm{mean} $  &     $\pm 1 \% \mathcal{S}_\mathrm{mean} $ 	 & $\pm 2 \% \sigma_{ice_\mathrm{mean}} $ \\
		\bottomrule		
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}


The accuracy of the $\sigma^2_\text{firn}$ estimation and subsequently 
of the temperature reconstruction 
obtained based on it, depends on the three correction terms  $\sigma^2_{\mathrm{ice}}$, 
$\sigma^2_{\mathrm{dis}}$ and the ice flow thinning $\mathcal{S}(z)$. For relatively shallow depths 
where $\sigma^2_{\mathrm{ice}}$
is relatively small compared to $\widehat{\sigma}_i^2$, ice diffusion can be accounted for with 
simple assumptions on the  borehole temperature profile and the ice flow. 
In a similar way, 
$\sigma^2_{\mathrm{dis}}$ is a well constrained parameter and depends only on the sampling
resolution $\Delta$ for discrete sampling schemes or the smoothing of the CFA measurement system.


Equation \ref{eq.firn_data} reveals an interesting property of the single isotopologue temperature estimation
technique. As seen, the result of the $\sigma^2_{\mathrm{firn}}$ calculation depends strongly on the 
ice flow thinning quantity $\mathcal{S}(z)^2$. Possible errors in the estimation of $\mathcal{S}(z)^2$ due to imperfections
in the modelling of the ice flow will inevitably be propagated to the $\sigma^2_{\mathrm{firn}}$ value
thus biasing the temperature estimation. Even though this appears to be a disadvantage in the method,
in some instances, it can be a useful tool for assessing the accuracy of ice flow models. 
Provided that for certain sections of the ice core there is a temperature estimate available based on 
other reconstruction methods  (borehole thermometry, \delN / \delAr) it is possible to estimate 
ice flow induced thinning of the ice core layers. Following this approach \cite{Gkinis2014} proposed
a correction in the existing accumulation rate history for the NorthGRIP ice core.

\subsection*{The annual spectral signal interference}
For some of the processed ice core data, we observed a prominent spectral feature 
at the low frequency area coinciding with the annual water isotopic signal
(i.e. an annual peak in the spectum).
The annual peak is prominent in ice cores with boundary conditions that mitigate the effects
of firn diffusion, notably low temperatures and high accumulation rates.
The resulting effect of such a spectral signature, is the artifactual biasing of the diffusion length estimation 
towards lower values and thus colder temperatures.
Figure \ref{fig:filter_function} shows the PSD of the $\delta$D series for a mid Holocene section from the GRIP ice core
(drill site characteristics in Table \ref{tbl:drill_sites}). 
A prominent spectral feature  is visible at  $f\approx6 \,\mathrm{cycles\,m^{-1}}$. This frequency is comparable to the 
expected frequency of the annual signal at $6.1\,\mathrm{cycles\,m^{-1}}$ as estimated from the annual layer thickness reconstruction 
of the GICC05 timescale \citep{Vinther2006}.


In order to evade the influence of the annual spectral signal on the diffusion length estimation, we propose the use of a weight 
function $w(f)$ in the spectrum as:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:weight_function}
w(f)= \left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
0 &  f_{\lambda} - \mathrm{d}f_{\lambda} \leq f \leq	 f_{\lambda} + \mathrm{d}f_{\lambda}\\ 
1                           &    f<f_{\lambda} - \mathrm{d}f_{\lambda}, f>f_{\lambda} + \mathrm{d}f_{\lambda}
\end{array} \right. {}
\end{equation}
where $f_\lambda$ is the frequency of the annual layer signal based on the reconstructed 
annual layer thickness $\lambda$ and $\mathrm{d}f_{\lambda}$ is the range around the frequency $f_{\lambda}$
at which the annual signal is detectable.
The weight function is multiplied with the optimization norm $\vert P_s - \mathbb{P}_s \vert^2$.
Figure \ref{fig:filter_function} also illustrates the effect of the weight function on the estimation of $P_s$ and subsequently 
the diffusion length value. When the weight function is used during the optimization process, there is an increase in the
diffusion length value by 0.2 cm, owing essentially to the exclusion of the annual signal peak from the minimization 
of $\vert P_s - \mathbb{P}_s \vert^2$.
While the value of $f_{\lambda}$ can be roughly predicted, the value of $\mathrm{d}f_{\lambda}$ usually requires visual 
inspection of the spectrum. 

Appendix \ref{sec:appendix_spectra_figures} shows the fitted PSD of all the ice core time series introduced in Sec. \ref{sec:icecore_results}.
Annual peak corrections are implemented in three out of thirteen ice core data series (GRIP late and mid Holocene and NEEM late Holocene).
For a specific ice core section's $f_{\lambda}$, the chosen weight function is in all three cases $w(f_{\lambda} - 0.5 \leq f \leq	 f_{\lambda} + 3) = 0$.

No distinguished multiannual variability exists in any of the ice core spectra as seen in Appendix \ref{sec:appendix_spectra_figures}.
A correction is therefore not implemented despite that climatic modes such as the North Atlantic Oscillation, 
El Ni\~{n}o-Southern Oscillation/Pacific Decadal Oscillation and the Southern Annular Mode 
have the potential to artifactually affect the diffusion length estimate in a similar way as the annual peak.

\subsection{The differential diffusion signal}\label{sec:diff_diffusion}
A second-order temperature reconstruction technique is possible based on the differential signal between
\delOx~and \delD. Due to the difference in the fractionation factors and the air diffusivities between the oxygen and deuterium isotopologues,
a differential diffusion signal is created in the firn column. Based on the calculation of the diffusion lengths
presented in Fig. \ref{fig:diffusion_length_profiles} we then compute the differential diffusion lengths ${}^{17}\Delta\sigma^2$
and ${}^{18}\Delta\sigma^2$ where
\begin{equation}
{}^{17}\Delta\sigma^2 =  \sigma^2_{17} - \sigma^2_{\mathrm{D}} \mathrm{\,\,\,and\,\,}{}^{18}\Delta\sigma^2 =  \sigma^2_{18} - \sigma^2_{\mathrm{D}}.
\end{equation}
As it can be seen in Fig. \ref{fig:diff_diffusion_example} the differential diffusion length signal is slightly larger for the case 
of ${}^{17}\Delta\sigma^2$ when compared to  ${}^{18}\Delta\sigma^2$. 




One obvious complication of the differential diffusion technique is the requirement for dual measurements of the water 
isotopologues, preferably performed on the same sample.
The evolution of IRMS techniques targeting the analysis of \delD~\citep{BIGELEISEN1952, Vaughn1998, Gehre1996, Begley1997} in ice cores has allowed for dual isotopic records
at high resolutions. With the advent of CRDS techniques and their customisation for CFA measurements,
simultaneous high resolution measurements of both \delOx~and \delD~have become a routine procedure.

The case of \delOxb~is more complicated as the greater abundance of $^{13}$C than $^{17}$O rules out the
possibility for an IRMS measurement  at mass/charge ratio ($m/z$) of 45 or 29 using 
CO$_2$ equilibration or reduction to CO respectively. Alternative approaches that exist include the
electrolysis method with CuSO$_4$ developed by  \cite{Meijer1998} as well as the fluorination method
presented by \cite{Baker2002} and implemented by \cite{Barkan2005} for dual-inlet IRMS systems.
These techniques target the measurement of the $^{17}${O}$_{\mathrm{excess}}$ parameter and are inferior for
\delOxb~measurements at high precision and have a very low sample throughput.
As a result, high resolution \delOxb~measurements from ice cores are currently non existent. 
Recent innovations however in CRDS spectroscopy \citep{Steig2014} allow for simultaneous 
triple isotopic measurements of \delD, \delOx~and \delOxb~in a way that  a precise and accurate measurement 
for both \delOxb~and $^{17}${O}$_{\mathrm{excess}}$ is possible. Therefore high resolution ice core datasets of
\delD, \delOx~and \delOxb~should be expected in the near future. 

The following analysis is focused on the ${}^{18}\Delta\sigma^2$ signal but it applies equally to 
the ${}^{17}\Delta\sigma^2$.
The stronger attenuation of the \delOx~signal with respect to the \delD~signal can be visually observed in the 
power spectral densities of the two signals. As seen in Fig. \ref{fig:spectral_diff_diffusion_example} the $\mathbb{P}_{\mathrm{S18}}$
signal reaches the noise level at a lower frequency when compared to the $\mathbb{P}_{\mathrm{SD}}$ signal.
At low frequencies  with high signal to noise ratio we can calculate the logarithm of the ratio of the two power spectral densities as
(i.e. neglecting the noise term):
\begin{equation} \label{eq:diff_regression}
\ln \left(\frac{P_\mathrm{D}}{P_{18}}\right) \approx k^2\left( \sigma^2_{18} - \sigma^2_{\mathrm{D}}\right) + 
\ln\left(\frac{P_{0_\mathrm{D}}}{P_{0_{18}}}\right) =
 {}^{18}\Delta \sigma^2\,k^2  + C.
\end{equation}
As seen in Eq. \ref{eq:diff_regression} and Fig. \ref{fig:spectral_diff_diffusion_example} 
(synthetic generated \delOx~and \delD~data as in Sec. \ref{sec:single_diffusion}) an estimate of the
${}^{18}\Delta\sigma^2$ parameter can be obtained by a linear fit of 
$\ln \left({P_\mathrm{D}}/{P_{18}}\right)$ in the low frequency area, 
thus requiring only two parameters $({}^{18}\Delta\sigma^2\mathrm{ \,and\, } C)$ to be tuned.
An interesting aspect of the differential diffusion method, is that in contrast to the single isotopologue diffusion length,
${}^{18}\Delta\sigma^2_\mathrm{firn}$ is a quantity that is independent of the sampling and solid ice diffusion thus eliminating the
uncertainties associated with these two parameters. This can be seen by simply using Eq. \ref{eq.firn_data}:
\begin{equation}
{}^{18}\Delta\sigma^2_{\mathrm{firn}} = \frac{\hat{\sigma}_{18}^2 - \sigma_{\mathrm{dis}}^2 - \sigma_{\mathrm{ice}}^2}{\mathcal{S}(z)^2} -  
\frac{\hat{\sigma}_\mathrm{D}^2 - 
	\sigma_{\mathrm{dis}}^2 - \sigma_{\mathrm{ice}}^2}{\mathcal{S}(z)^2} =  \frac{\hat{\sigma}_{18}^2 - 
	\hat{\sigma}_\mathrm{D}^2}{\mathcal{S}(z)^2}.
\end{equation}
Accurate estimates of the thinning function however still play a key role in the differential diffusion technique.
One more complication of the differential diffusion technique is the selection of the frequency range in 
which one chooses to apply the linear regression. Often visual inspection is required in order to 
designate a cut-off frequency until which the linear regression can be applied. In most cases 
identifying the cut-off frequency, or at least a reasonable area around it is reasonably straight-forward.
Though in a small number of cases, spectral features in the low frequency area seem to have a strong 
influence on the slope of the linear regression and thus on the ${}^{18}\Delta\sigma^2$. As a result,
visual inspection of the regression result is always advised in order to avoid biases.

Another  way of estimating the differential diffusion signal is to subtract the single diffusion 
spectral estimates $\sigma^2_{18}$ and $\sigma^2_{\mathrm{D}}$. 
Theoretically this approach should be inferior to the linear fit approach due to the fact that 
more degrees of freedom are involved in the estimation of $\sigma^2_{18}$ and 
$\sigma^2_{\mathrm{D}}$ (8 versus 2; 3 if the cutoff frequency is included).
Here we will test both approaches.



\subsection*{Linear correlation method}
An alternative way to calculate the differential diffusion signal ${}^{18}\Delta\sigma^2$
is based on the assumption that the initial precipitated isotopic signal presents a \Dxs~that
is invariable with time and as a consequence of this, the correlation signal between \delOx~and \delD~(hereafter \delcorrel) is expected
to have a maximum value at the time of deposition.
The \Dxs~signal is defined as the deviation from the metoric water line $\mathrm{d_{xs}}= \delta\mathrm{D}- 8\cdot\delta^{18}\mathrm{O} $ \citep{craig, Dansgaard}.
From the moment of deposition, the difference in diffusion between the \delOx~and \delD~signals results
in a decrease of the \delcorrel~ value. Hence, diffusing the \delD~signal 
with a Gaussian kernel of standard deviation equal to ${}^{18}\Delta\sigma^2$ will maximize 
the value of \delcorrel~\citep{vanderWel2015a} as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:correlation_example}.  
Thus, the ${}^{18}\Delta\sigma^2$ value is found when the \delcorrel~value has its maximum.

This type of estimation is independent of spectral estimates of the \delOx~and \delD~time series
and does not pose any requirements for measurement noise characterization or selection of
cut-off frequencies. However uncertainties related to the densification and ice flow processes, affect
this method equally as they do for the spectrally based differential diffusion temperature estimation. 
In this study, we test the applicability of the method on synthetic and real ice core data.
We acknowledge that the assumption that the \Dxs~signal is constant with time is 
not entirely consistent with the fact that there is a small seasonal cycle in the \Dxs~signal \citep{Johnsen1989}.
It is thus likely to result in inaccuracies.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{The diffusion length ratio}

A third way of using the diffusion lengths as proxies for temperature can be based on the calculation 
of the ratio of two different diffusion lengths. From Eq. \ref{eq.difflengthintegration} we can evaluate the ratio 
of two different isotopologues $j$ and $k$ as:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\sigma_j^2 \left( \rho \right)}{\sigma_k^2 \left( \rho \right)} = \frac{\displaystyle \frac{\,1\,}{\rho^2} \int 2\rho^2 
{\left( \frac{\mathrm{d}\rho}{\mathrm{d}t}\right)}^{-1}\! D_j \!\left( \rho \right) \,\mathrm{d}\rho}
{\displaystyle  \frac{\,1\,}{\rho^2} \displaystyle \int2\rho^2 
{\left( \frac{\mathrm{d}\rho}{\mathrm{d}t}\right)}^{-1}\! D_k \!\left( \rho \right) \,\mathrm{d}\rho},
\label{eq.difflengthratio}
\end{equation}
and by substituting the firn diffusivities as defined in Appendix \ref{sec:appendix_firn_diffusion} and according to 
\cite{Johnsen2000} we get:
\begin{equation}
 \frac{\sigma_j^2 \left( \rho \right)}{\sigma_k^2 \left( \rho \right)} = 
\frac{D_{\mathrm{a}j} \alpha_k}{D_{\mathrm{a}k} \alpha_j}\,
\frac{\displaystyle \frac{\,1\,}{\rho^2} \int 2\rho^2 
{\left( \frac{\mathrm{d}\rho}{\mathrm{d}t}\right)}^{-1}\!  \frac{m\,p}{R\,T\,\tau}
\left(\frac{\,1\,}{\,\rho\,} - \frac{\,1\,}{\,\rho_{\mathrm{ice}}\,}\right) \,\mathrm{d}\rho}
{\displaystyle \frac{\,1\,}{\rho^2}  \int2\rho^2 
{\left( \frac{\mathrm{d}\rho}{\mathrm{d}t}\right)}^{-1}\!  \frac{m\,p}{R\,T\tau}
\left(\frac{\,1\,}{\,\rho\,} - \frac{\,1\,}{\,\rho_{\mathrm{ice}}\,}\right) \,\mathrm{d}\rho} = 
\frac{D_{\mathrm{a}j} \alpha_k}{D_{\mathrm{a}k} \alpha_j}.
\label{eq.difflengthratio_b}
\end{equation}
As a result, the ratio of the diffusion lengths is dependent on temperature through the parameterizations
of the fractionation factors ($\alpha$) and carries no dependence to parameters related to the densification rates nor the 
atmospheric pressure. Additionally, it is a quantity that is independent of depth.
Here we give the analytical expressions of all the isotopologues combinations by substituting the diffusivities and the fractionation
factors:
\begin{align}
\sigma^2_{18}/\sigma^2_{\mathrm{D}} & = 0.93274\cdot \exp(16288/T^2-11.839/T)\\
\sigma^2_{17}/\sigma^2_{\mathrm{D}} & = 0.933\cdot \exp(16288/T^2-6.263/T)\\
\sigma^2_{18}/\sigma^2_{17} & = 0.99974\cdot \exp(-5.57617/T)
\label{eq.difflengthratio_c}
\end{align}

A data-based diffusion length ratio estimate can be obtained by estimating the single 
diffusion length values as described in Sec. \ref{sec:single_diffusion}
and thereafter applying the necessary corrections as in Eq. \ref{eq.firn_data}. 
An interesting aspect of the ratio estimation is that it is not dependent on the
ice flow thinning as seen below
\begin{equation} 
\left( \frac{\sigma^2_{18}}{\sigma^2_\mathrm{D}} \right)_{\mathrm{firn}}  =
\frac{ \hat{\sigma}^2_{18} - \sigma^2_{\mathrm{dis}} - \sigma^2_{\mathrm{ice}} }{\hat{\sigma}^2_{\mathrm{D}} - 
	\sigma^2_{\mathrm{dis}} - \sigma^2_{\mathrm{ice}} }.
\end{equation}
while the method still depends on the sampling and ice diffusion.

\section{Results}\label{sec:results}
\subsection{Synthetic data test} \label{sec:synthetic_results}
We present here a test of accuracy and precision for the estimates of the various 
quantities used for diffusion based temperature estimations outlined in Sec. \ref{sec:methods}. The tests consist of the generation of
synthetic data for \delOxb, \delOx~and \delD~and subsequent numerical diffusion with diffusion 
lengths as calculated for case A and B (as presented in Fig. \ref{fig:diffusion_length_profiles}).
The time series are then sampled at a resolution of $2.5\,\mathrm{cm}$ and white measurement noise is added. Eventually,
estimates of diffusion lengths for all three isotopologues are obtained using the techniques we have described 
in the previous sections. The full description of how the synthetic data are generated is outlined in Appendix \ref{sec:appendix_synthetic}.

The process of time series generation is repeated 500 times. 
For each iteration, the quantities $\sigma_{17}$, $\sigma_{18}$,
$\sigma_\mathrm{D}$, ${}^{17}\Delta\sigma^2$, ${}^{18}\Delta\sigma^2$ and 
the ratios $\sigma^2_{18}/\sigma^2_{\mathrm{D}}$,
$\sigma^2_{17}/\sigma^2_{\mathrm{D}}$ and $\sigma^2_{18}/\sigma^2_{17}$ are estimated. 
The differential diffusion signals are estimated 
using the three different techniques as described in Sec. \ref{sec:diff_diffusion}.
We designate the subtraction technique with
I, the linear regression with II and the correlation method with III. 
For every value of the diffusion estimates we calculate a firn temperature where
the uncertainties related to the firn diffusion model ($A$, $\rho_{co}$, $\rho_o$, $P$, $\mathcal{S}$ and $\sigma_{ice}$ in Table \ref{tbl:model_unc}) are included. 
Finally for the total of the 500 iterations we calculate a mean firn temperature $\overline{T}$, 
a standard deviation and a mean bias as: 
\begin{equation}
\text{MB} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i = 1}^{N} T_i - T_{\text{sur}} = \overline{T} - T_{\text{sur}},
\end{equation}
where $i = 1,2,\dots,N$ signifies the iteration number, $T_i$ is the synthetic 
data-based estimated temperature and $T_{\text{sur}}$ is the model forcing  
surface temperature for the case A and B scenarios.
For each technique, the precision $s_{\bar{T}}$ is calculated by averaging 
the squared standard deviations of all simulations. 
The results of the experiment are presented in Table \ref{tbl:synthetic_diff_lens} and the calculated 
mean biases are illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:synthetic_data_bias}.
The diffusion length ratio approach yields very large uncertainty bars (see Table \ref{tbl:synthetic_diff_lens}) and thus these results are not 
included in Fig. \ref{fig:synthetic_data_bias}.

\subsection{Ice core data test} \label{sec:icecore_results}
We also use a number of high resolution, high precision ice core data, in order to benchmark the 
diffusion temperature reconstruction techniques that we have  presented.
The aim of this benchmark test is to utilize the various  reconstruction techniques for a range of
boundary conditions that is (a) as broad as possible with respect to mean annual surface temperature 
and accumulation and (b) representative of existing polar ice core sites.
Additionally, we have made an effort in focusing on ice core  data sets that reflect conditions as close as possible to 
present. As a result, the majority of the data sets presented here are from relatively shallow depths and as a result
reflect climatic conditions typical of the late Holocene. Where this was not possible due to limited data availability,
we have used data originating from deeper sections of the ice cores with an age  
of about 10ka b2k reflecting conditions of  the early Holocene. In Table \ref{tbl:drill_sites} we provide relevant 
information for each data set as well as the present 
temperature and accumulation conditions for the drill site from which each data set originates.

The data sets were produced using a variety of techniques
both with respect to the analysis itself (IRMS/CRDS), as well as with respect to the sample resolution and preparation
(discrete/CFA). The majority of the data sets were analysed using CRDS instrumentation. In particular the L1102i, L2120i and L2130i
variants of the Picarro CRDS analyser were utilized for both discrete and CFA measurements of \delOx~and \delD.
The rest of the data sets were analysed using IRMS techniques with either $\mathrm{CO}_2$ equilibration or 
high temperature carbon reduction. For the case of the NEEM early Holocene data set, we work with two data sections that span the same 
depth interval and consist of discretely sampled and CFA measured data respectively.
Additionally, the Dome C and Dome F data sections represent conditions typical for the East Antarctic Plateau and are sampled
using a different approach ($2.5 \, \mathrm{cm}$ resolution discrete samples for the Dome C section and high resolution CFA measurements
for the Dome F section).

In a way similar to the synthetic data test, we apply the various reconstruction techniques on every ice core data
section, we estimate the corresponding diffusion parameters and subsequently the temperatures
corresponding to them. No reconstruction techniques involving \delOxb ~are presented here due to lack of 
\delOxb ~data. In order to achieve an uncertainty estimation for every reconstruction, we 
perform a sensitivity test that is based on 1000 repetitions. Assuming that every ice core section 
consists of $J$ \delOx ~and \delD ~points, then a repetition is based on a 
data subsection with size $J'$ that varies in the interval $\left[ J/2, J \right]$. This ``jittering''
of the subsection size happens around the midpoint of every section and $J'$ is 
drawn from a uniform distribution. 
Eventually, for every reconstruction method and every ice core site, we
calculate a mean and a standard deviation for the diffusion estimate, as well as a mean and a standard 
deviation for the temperature. 
The standard deviation accounts for uncertainties related to both the estimation of the diffusion length
and uncertainties originating from the firn diffusion model, ice flow thinning model
and ice diffusion (through the parameters: $A$, $\rho_{co}$, $\rho_o$, $P$, $\mathcal{S}$ and $\sigma_{ice}$).
%We would like to point out 
%that this type of sensitivity test does not take into account uncertainties originating from 
%the densification or diffusion physical quantities and their parameterizations, or inaccuracies 
%due to the ice flow thinning model or solid ice and sampling diffusion estimates. 
Results are presented in Table \ref{tbl:icecore_results}. 
The estimated temperatures for ice cores covering the late-mid Holocene and early Holocene are 
shown in Fig. \ref{fig:all_temps} and \ref{fig:early_temps} respectively.


\subsection{The fractionation factors} \label{sec:results_fractionation}

The influence of the fractionation factors ($\alpha_{18}$, $\alpha_\mathrm{D}$) on the reconstructed temperatures are
tested on ice core data sets representative of a broad range of temperatures. By comparing the results of different parameterization schemes, it is possible to quantify the influence of the choice of parametrization on the absolute temperature estimates. This is especially relevant for temperatures below $-40\mathrm{^oC}$, as the confidence of the parameterized fractionation factors have been shown to be low for such cold temperatures \citep{Ellehoj2013}. 
Similar to the ice core data test (Sec. \ref{sec:icecore_results}), the corresponding diffusion parameters and subsequently the temperatures are based on
a sensitivity test of 1000 repetitions.
The results are displayed in Fig. \ref{fig:fractionation_temps}, where the temperatures resulting from the parametrizations of
\cite{Majoube1971} ($\alpha_{18}$) and \cite{Merlivat1967} ($\alpha_\mathrm{D}$) are compared to the temperatures resulting from the parametrizations of \cite{Ellehoj2013} ($\alpha_{18}$, $\alpha_\mathrm{D}$) and \cite{Lamb2015} ($\alpha_\mathrm{D}$).
In the latter case, the parameterization of $\alpha_{18}$ from \cite{Majoube1971} is used for the dual diffusion length methods.

\section{Discussion}\label{sec:discussion}

\subsection{Synthetic data}\label{sec:discussion_synthetic}
Based on the results of the sensitivity experiment with 
synthetic data, the following can be inferred. Firstly, the three techniques based on the 
single isotope diffusion, perform similarly and of all the techniques
tested, yield the highest precision with a $s_{\bar{T}} \approx 1.0 \,{}^{\circ} \text{C}$.
Additionally, the estimated temperatures $\overline{T}$ are within 1$s_{\bar{T}}$
of the forcing temperature  $T_{\text{sur}}$, a result pointing to a good performance with respect to 
the accuracy of the temperature estimation. 

The precision of the differential diffusion techniques is slightly
inferior to single diffusion with the subtraction 
technique being the least precise of all three differential diffusion approaches ($s_{\bar{T}} \approx 2.6 \,{}^{\circ} \text{C}$). 
A possible reason for this result may be the fact that the subtraction technique relies on the 
tuning of 8 optimization parameters as described in Sec. \ref{sec:single_diffusion} and 
\ref{sec:diff_diffusion}.
Both the linear fit and the correlation techniques yield precision estimates of $1.8 \,{}^{\circ} \text{C}$ and 
 $1.3 \,{}^{\circ} \text{C}$, respectively.
Despite the high precision of the correlation technique, the tests shows that the technique has a bias toward colder temperatures. 
The linear fit is therefore the most optimal of the differential diffusion techniques.
All 10 experiments utilizing differential diffusion methods, yield an accuracy that lies within the 2$s_{\bar{T}}$ range
(1$s_{\bar{T}}$ range for 9 out of 10 experiments). We can conclude that experiments involving the estimation 
of the diffusion length ratio indicate that the latter are practically unusable due to very high uncertainties
with $s_{\bar{T}}$ averaging to a value of  $\approx 16 \,{}^{\circ} \text{C}$ for all four experiments.
A general trend that seems to be apparent for all the experiments, is that the results for the case A forcing yield
slightly lower uncertainties when compared to those for the case B forcing, likely indicating a
temperature and accumulation influence in the performance of all the reconstruction techniques. 


\subsection{Ice core data}\label{sec:discussion_icecore}
The precision $s_{\bar{T}}$ of each reconstruction technique has been quantified
by averaging the squared standard deviations of the reconstructed temperatures (Table \ref{tbl:icecore_results}). 
In accordance with the results from the synthetic data test, the most precise reconstructions are obtained when using the single isotope diffusion methods. 
The single diffusion methods have a $s_{\bar{T}}$ of $1.1\,^\mathrm{o}\mathrm{C}$, while the differential diffusion methods ${}^{18}\Delta\sigma^2$ I, II and III
have a $s_{\bar{T}}$ of $2.6\,^\mathrm{o}\mathrm{C}$,
$1.9\,^\mathrm{o}\mathrm{C}$ and $4.8\,^\mathrm{o}\mathrm{C}$, respectively.
The correlation-based technique is hereby shown to be the least precise differential diffusion method.
This differs from the result of the synthetic data, where the correlation-based technique
had the most precise results. 
Of the differential diffusion methods, the linear fit of the logarithmic ratio provides the most precise results, 
with a precision similar to that found from the synthetic data (Sec. \ref{sec:discussion_synthetic}).
Of all the tested techniques, the diffusion length ratio method is the least precise with 
a $s_{\bar{T}}$ of $11.8\,^\mathrm{o}\mathrm{C}$. 
A similar precision was found from the synthetic data.

It is not possible to quantify the accuracy of the methods when applied on short ice core data sections,
as the reconstructed temperatures represent the integrated firn column temperature.
The reconstructed temperatures should therefore not necessarily be completely identical to present day annual temperatures.
However, clear outliers can still be inferred from the data as temperature estimates that deviate with
$-30\,^\mathrm{o}\mathrm{C}$ from the present day annual mean temperatures are unrealistic.
Alternately, the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) has been calculated in order to quantify the consistency between the
reconstructed temperatures of any two methods ($x$ and $y$):
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{RMSD} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{j = 1}^{n} \left(x_j - y_j\right)^2}{n}},
\end{equation}
where $j$ represents the drill site and $n$ the total number of sites.

First we address the correlation-based and diffusion length ratio techniques as these two
methods result in temperatures that clearly deviate with present day annual mean temperatures.
Besides the low precision of the diffusion length ratio method, 
its temperature esimates are highly inconsistent with the results of the 
other techniques, with RMSDs varying from $21\, ^\mathrm{o}\mathrm{C}$ to $34 \, ^\mathrm{o}\mathrm{C}$. 
For the correlation-based technique,
similar high RMSDs are found between the temperature estimates of the ${}^{18}\Delta\sigma^2$ I and III, and the ${}^{18}\Delta\sigma^2$ II and III techniques. Here, the RMSDs are found to be $24.6\,^\mathrm{o}\mathrm{C}$ and $23.5\,^\mathrm{o}\mathrm{C}$, respectively.
A high RMSD ($24.5\,^\mathrm{o}\mathrm{C}$) is also found when comparing the temperature estimates originating from the $\sigma^2_{18}$ and ${}^{18}\Delta\sigma^2$ III methods. 
The large differences between the correlation-based and spectral-based temperature estimates are particularly pronounced for GRIP, NEEM (Fig. \ref{fig:all_temps}), Dome C and the discretely measured NEEM section (Fig. \ref{fig:early_temps}).
In addition, it can be seen that the correlation-based method results in significantly different 
temperatures for the discretely and continuously measured NEEM section.
A similar difference is not found from the spectral-based methods. Instead, these provide
consistent temperatures independent of the processing scheme.
The generally poor performance of the correlation-based method on ice core data contradicts the high accuracy and precision of the synthetic reconstructions, and is most likely caused by an oversimplification of the relationship between $\delta\mathrm{D}$ and $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$. The generation of the synthetic data is based on the assumption that $\delta\mathrm{D} = 8\cdot \delta^{18}\mathrm{O} + 10 \permil$. However, this premise neglects the time dependent \Dxs~signal. 
The correlation-based method can therefore be used to accurately reconstruct synthetic temperatures, while the accuracy and precision are much lower for ice core data,
as such data has been influenced by the \Dxs~signal.
In addition, these temperature estimates have been shown to be dependent on the sampling process. The correlation-based method therefore yields uncertain estimates of the differential diffusion length.



The temperature estimates originating from the $\sigma^2_{18}$ and $\sigma^2_{\mathrm{D}}$ methods are found to have a RMSD of $0.7\,^\mathrm{o}\mathrm{C}$. This shows that the $\sigma^2_{18}$ and $\sigma^2_{\mathrm{D}}$ methods result in similar temperatures, which is consistent with the high accuracies found from the synthetic data test.
The temperature estimates of the ${}^{18}\Delta\sigma^2$ I method is similar to the present day annual temperature in six out of nine cases. 
However, the results of the ${}^{18}\Delta\sigma^2$ I and II techniques have a RMSD of $3.8\,^\mathrm{o}\mathrm{C}$.
The seemingly accurate performance of the ${}^{18}\Delta\sigma^2$ I method could be either a coincidence or correct. 
It is difficult to select the most accurate results as both of the differential diffusion techniques
before performed well in the accuracy test with the synthetic data.
One should therefore not have a preferred technique without utilizing both methods on longer ice core sections.
Basically, the reconstructed temperatures could be similar when the temperatures have been averaged over a longer record.
Besides the internal differences in the results of the differential techniques, most of the temperature estimates do not 
match the results of the single diffusion lengths.
This is clear from the RMSDs between the temperature estimates of the $\sigma^2_{18}$ and ${}^{18}\Delta\sigma^2$ I methods, 
and the $\sigma^2_{18}$ and ${}^{18}\Delta\sigma^2$ II methods which are found to be  
$3.9\,^\mathrm{o}\mathrm{C}$ and $4.6\,^\mathrm{o}\mathrm{C}$, respectively.

We want to acknowledge that although the single diffusion length methods here provide
the most precise results, the differential diffusion methods 
should still be superior in older glacial ice where ice diffusion dominates 
and the sample diffusion exceeds that of the spectral-based diffusion length.
This does not apply in this study as we use ice core data from the Holocene period.

\subsection{The fractionation factors} \label{sec:fractionation}
The temperature estimates resulting from the different fractionation factor parametrizations
are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:fractionation_temps}. 
For each method, the influence of the choice of parametrization on the reconstructed
temperatures has been quantified by calculating the RMSD between temperature estimates of two parametrizations.
Comparing the parametrizations of \citet{Ellehoj2013} to those of \citet{Majoube1971} and \citet{Merlivat1967},
the RMSDs of reconstructions that are based on the single diffusion lengths $\sigma^2_{18}$ and $\sigma^2_{\mathrm{D}}$ are
$0.04^\mathrm{o}\mathrm{C}$ and $0.4^\mathrm{o}\mathrm{C}$.
Thus, it is evident that the choice of fractionation factors has an insignificant effect
on the results of the $\sigma^2_{18}$ method and a small effect on the results of the $\sigma^2_{\mathrm{D}}$ method.
The choice of parameterization has a greater effect on the temperatures of the ${}^{18}\Delta\sigma^2$ techniques,
where the temperature estimate of the ${}^{18}\Delta\sigma^2$ I, II and III techniques have RMSDs of 
$2.3^\mathrm{o}\mathrm{C}$, $2.3^\mathrm{o}\mathrm{C}$ and $2.2^\mathrm{o}\mathrm{C}$, respectively.
Comparing the parametrization of \citet{Lamb2015} to that of \citet{Merlivat1967},
the temperatures of the ${}^{18}\Delta\sigma^2$ I, II and III techniques have RMSDs of 
$0.9^\mathrm{o}\mathrm{C}$, $0.9^\mathrm{o}\mathrm{C}$ and $1.0^\mathrm{o}\mathrm{C}$, respectively.
In general, smaller RMSDs are found when comparing with temperature estimates based on the \citet{Lamb2015} parametrization.
For instance, comparing the temperatures of the ${\sigma^2_{18}}/{\sigma^2_\mathrm{D}}$ technique based on \citet{Lamb2015} with those of \citet{Merlivat1967},
the ${\sigma^2_{18}}/{\sigma^2_\mathrm{D}}$ technique yields a RMSD of $5.9^\mathrm{o}\mathrm{C}$,
while the RMSD is $11.0^\mathrm{o}\mathrm{C}$ when comparing the results based on the parametrizations of
\citet{Ellehoj2013} with those of \citet{Majoube1971} and \citet{Merlivat1967}.
There are two reasons to why the RMSDs are smaller when comparing with the \citet{Lamb2015} parametrization:
the parametrized $\alpha_\mathrm{D}$ of \citet{Merlivat1967} differs more with that of \citet{Ellehoj2013} than with that of \citet{Lamb2015},
and the same $\alpha_{18}$ parametrization is used when comparing with \citet{Lamb2015}.

The ${\sigma^2_{18}}/{\sigma^2_\mathrm{D}}$ method is significantly more influenced by the 
fractionation factors. 
The high RMSDs imply that even if the diffusion length ratio is estimated with high confidence,
the method is still too sensitive to the choice of parameterization.
This makes the method less suitable as a paleoclimatic thermometer.

\section{Conclusions}  %% \conclusions[modified heading if necessary]
This study assessed the performance of six different diffusion-based temperature reconstruction
techniques.
By applying the methods on synthetic data, it was demonstrated that each method could be used to accurately reconstruct unbiased temperatures.
Moreover, this approach facilitated precision estimates of each method.
The precision of each technique was further quantified by
utilizing every variety of the diffusion-based temperature proxy on thirteen high resolution 
data sets from Greenland and Antarctica.
The results showed that the single diffusion length methods yielded similar temperatures
and that they are the most precise of all the presented reconstruction techniques.
The most precise of the three differential diffusion length techniques was the linear fit of
the logarithmic ratio.
The most uncertain way of reconstructing past temperatures was by employing the diffusion length ratio method.
The results from the correlation-based method were inconsistent to the results obtained through the spectral-based methods,
and the method was considered to yield uncertain estimates of the differential diffusion length.

It was furthermore shown that the choice of fractionation factor parametrization 
only had a small impact on the results from the single diffusion length methods, 
while the influence was slightly higher for the differential diffusion length methods.
The diffusion length ratio method was highly sensitive to the fractionation factor parametrization,
and the method is not suitable as a paleoclimatic thermometer. 

In conclusion, despite that the dual diffusion techniques seem to be the more optimal choices 
due to their independence of sampling and ice diffusion or densification and thinning processes,
the uncertain estimates should outweigh the theoretical advantages.
From the combined analyses of the synthetic data and ice core data, this study has demonstrated that methods 
based on the single isotope diffusion lengths result in the most accurate and precise estimates of past temperatures.

\section{Firn Diffusivity} \label{sec:appendix_firn_diffusion}
	
We express the diffusivity as a function of firn density $\rho$ and we use \citep{Johnsen2000}:
\begin{equation}
D\!\left(\rho\right) = \frac{m\,p\,D_{\mathrm{a}i}}{R\,T\,\alpha_\mathrm{i}\,\tau}
\left(\frac{\,1\,}{\,\rho\,} - \frac{\,1\,}{\,\rho_{\mathrm{ice}}\,}\right).
\label{eq:firn_diffusivity}
\end{equation}
The terms used in Eq. (\ref{eq:firn_diffusivity}) and the parametrization used for them are described below:
\begin{itemize}

\item{m: molar weight  (kg)}

\item{p: saturation vapor pressure over ice (Pa). We use \citep{Murphy2006}:
\begin{equation}
p = \exp \left(9.5504 - \frac{5723.265}{T} + 3.530\,\ln\!\left( T \right) - 0.0073\,T \right)
\label{eq:sat_vap_pres}
\end{equation}}

\item{$D_{\mathrm{a}i}$:  diffusivity of water vapor (for isotopologue $i$) in air ($\mathrm{m}^2 \mathrm{s}^{-1}$). 
For the diffusivity of the abundant isotopologue water vapor $D_{\mathrm{a}}$ we use \citep{Hall1976}:
\begin{equation}
D_{\mathrm{a}} = 2.1\cdot 10^{-5} {\left(\frac{T}{T_o}\right)}^{1.94} \left(\frac{P_o}{P}\right) 
\label{eq:air_diffusivity}
\end{equation}
with $P_{\mathrm{o}} = 1 \;\mathrm{Atm}$, $T_{\mathrm{o}} = 273.15 \;\mathrm{K}$  and $P, \,T$ the ambient pressure (Atm) and temperature (K).
Additionally from \cite{MerlivatandJouzel} $D_{a^2\mathrm{H}} = 0.9755{D_{\mathrm{a}}}$ and 
$D_{\mathrm{a}^{18}\mathrm{O}} = 0.9723{D_{\mathrm{a}}}$ and from \cite{Barkan2007}
$D_{\mathrm{a}^{17}\mathrm{O}} = 0.98555{D_{\mathrm{a}}}$.}

\item{R: molar gas constant $R = 8.3144 \,\,(\mathrm{m}^3\mathrm{PaK}^{-1}\mathrm{mol}^{-1})$}

\item{T: Ambient temperature $(\mathrm{K})$}

\item{$\alpha_{\mathrm{i}}$: Ice -- Vapor fractionation factor.  we use the formulations by \cite{Majoube1971},
	 \cite{Merlivat1967} and \cite{Barkan2005} for $\alpha_{\mathrm{s/v}}^{2}$, $\alpha_{\mathrm{s/v}}^{18}$ and $\alpha_{\mathrm{s/v}}^{17}$ respectively.
\begin{align}
\alpha_{\mathrm{Ice/Vapor}} \left(^{2}\mathrm{H}/^{1} \mathrm{H} \right) &=0.9098\exp(16288/T^2)\\
\alpha_{\mathrm{Ice/Vapor}} \left( ^{18}\mathrm{O}/^{16} \mathrm{O} \right) &=  0.9722\exp(11.839/T)\\
\alpha_{\mathrm{Ice/Vapor}} \left( ^{17}\mathrm{O}/^{16} \mathrm{O}\right)  & = \exp\left(0.529\ln\left[\alpha_{\mathrm{Ice/Vapor}} \left( ^{18}\mathrm{O}/^{16} \mathrm{O} \right)\right] \right)
\label{eq1617_ch4_app}
\end{align}}

\item{$\tau$: The firn tortuosity. We use \citet{Schwander1988} as in \cite{Johnsen2000}. More recent results include \citet{Freitag2002} and \citet{Adolph2014}.
\begin{equation}
\frac{\,1\,}{\,\tau\,} = 1 - b\cdot\left(\frac{\rho}{\rho_{\mathrm{ice}}}\right)^2 \,\,\,\,\,\rho \le 
\frac{\rho_{\mathrm{ice}}}{\sqrt{b}},\,\,b = 1.3
\label{eq:firn_tort}
\end{equation}

Based on Eq. (\ref{eq:firn_tort}), $\,\,\tau \rightarrow \infty$ for $\rho>804.3\,\mathrm{kg \, m}^{-3}$
}

\section{The firn temperature profile} \label{sec:firn_temp_profile}
Temperature variations in the firn column affect the amount of firn diffusion.  
The temperature profile $T$ is modeled by solving the general heat transfer equation:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:crank2}
\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \kappa\frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial z^2} - \left(w - \left( \frac{\kappa}{\rho}+ \frac{\partial \kappa}{\partial \rho}\right) \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial z}\right) \frac{\partial T}{\partial z},
\end{equation}
where $\rho$ is the density, $w$ is the vertical velocity and $\kappa$ is the thermal diffusivity of firn.
Here the internal heat production and the heat transport in the horizontal plane have been neglected.
The thermal diffusivity of firn depends on density and the thermal diffusivity of ice ($\kappa_{ice}$) \citep{Schwander1997}:
\begin{equation}
\kappa = \kappa_{ice}\left(\frac{\rho}{\rho_i}\right)^{1-0.5(\rho/\rho_i)},
\end{equation}
where $\rho_i$ is the density of ice.
The thermal diffusivity of ice is defined as \citep{Paterson}:
\begin{equation}
\kappa_{ice} = \frac{k}{\rho_i c_p} = \frac{9.828\cdot \exp(-5.7 \cdot 10^{-3}T)\cdot 3.16\cdot 10^7}{\rho_i(152.5 + 7.122T)},
\end{equation}
where $c_p$ is the specific heat capacity and $k$ is the thermal conductivity of ice.
This allows for the computation of changes in thermal diffusivity with density:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \kappa}{\partial \rho}= \kappa \left(\frac{1}{\rho} -\frac{1}{2\rho_i}\right)\left(1 + \ln\left(\frac{\rho}{\rho_i}\right)\right).
\end{equation}
The surface temperature is parameterized as fluctuations around the mean annual temperature ($T_{mean}$) as in \cite{Simonsen2011}:
\begin{equation}
T_{surf}(t) = T_{mean} + A \cos\left(b t\right) + B \cos\left(2 b t\right),
\end{equation}
where $A = 16.5$, $B= 3.0$ and $b = 0.5236$ are constants controlling the temperature amplitude and narrowness of the summer peak.

Figure \ref{fig:firn_temp_profle} shows the temperature variation a snow package experiences as it moves downwards.
The seasonal temperature variation penetrates down to a depth of $10-12\, \mathrm{m}$. 
The heat equation is solved numerically by using a Crank-Nicolson scheme \citep{durran}.

\section{Ice Diffusivity} \label{sec:appendix_ice_diffusion}
The solid ice diffusivity parametrization we use in this study is based on \cite{Ramseier1967} 
as it is consistent with previous studies.
In this section we provide the reader with parametrizations from other studies. 
We assume an Arrhenius type relationship for the ice diffusivity of the form:
\begin{equation}
D_{\mathrm{ice}} = D_o \exp \left(- \frac{X}{T} \right) \;\mathrm{ [m^2 s^{-1}]} . 
\label{eq.icediffusivity_generic}
\end{equation}
In Eq. \ref{eq.icediffusivity_generic}, $D_o$ is the pre-exponential factor in $\mathrm{m^2s^{-1}}$
and $X$ is the Arrhenius coefficient where $X = Q/R$ with $Q$ being the activation energy in 
$\mathrm{kcalmol^{-1}}$ and R the universal gas constant $(8.314 \; \mathrm{JK^{-1}mol^{-1}})$.

Results from four experimental studies are summarized in Table \ref{table_ice_diffusivities}. Together with 
the pre-exponential factors  and the activation energies, we also evaluate the four different expressions 
of ice diffusivities for the temperature of $T = 245 \mathrm{K}$.

When $D_{\mathrm{ice}}$ is known, a $\sigma_{\mathrm{ice}}$ calculation can be obtained by solving Eq. \ref{eq.diflength}.
Using the integrating factor $F = \exp \left( \int -2 \dot{\varepsilon}_z\left(t\right)  \mathrm{d} t \right)$ we get:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \left( \sigma_{\mathrm{ice}}^2\,e^{\int  -2\dot{\varepsilon}_{\mathrm{z}} \left( t
\right) \mathrm{d} t} \right) = 2 D_{\mathrm{ice}}  \left( t \right) \,e^{\int -2\dot{\varepsilon}_{\mathrm{z}} \left( t \right) \mathrm{d} t}
\label{eq38_ch4}
\end{equation}
This finally yields the ice diffusion length for a layer with age $t'$ that has undergone 
ice flow thinning $S(t')$:
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{\mathrm{ice}}^2 \left( t' \right) = 
{S \left( t' \right)}^{2} \,\int_0^{t'} 2 D_{\mathrm{ice}} \left( t \right) S \left( t \right) ^{-2} \,\mathrm{d} t
\label{eq39_ch4}
\end{equation}

\section{Generating synthetic data}	\label{sec:appendix_synthetic}

The time series are generated using an AR-1 process with coefficient $r_1$ and variance $\varepsilon$
\begin{equation}
\delta_{\mathrm{n}} - r_1 \delta_{\mathrm{n-1}} = \varepsilon_{\mathrm{n}}.
\label{eq:appen_ar1}
\end{equation}
For the AR-1 process we use $r_1 = 0.3$ and $\varepsilon = 120\,\permil^2$ for case A and $200\,\permil^2$ for case B.
Each data section is $20\, \mathrm{m}$ long and has an initial spacing of 
$10^{-3}\, \mathrm{m}$. The \delD~and \delOxb~series are then
generated assuming a \Dxs~signal of $10\,\permil$ and an
$\Delta^{17}\mathrm{O}$ signal of 0 per meg:
\begin{align} 
\delta\mathrm{D} = 8 \cdot \delta^{18}\mathrm{O} + 10 \permil&\\
\Delta^{17}\mathrm{O} = \ln(\delta^{17}\mathrm{O}+1) - 0.528&\ln(\delta^{18}\mathrm{O} +1)
\end{align}

The time series are then forward-diffused by means of numerical convolution 
with a Gaussian filter of variance $\sigma^2_{input}$ equal to the diffusion length 
for every case (Table \ref{tbl:synthetic_diff_lens}). 
This input diffusion length is calculated as:
\begin{equation}
\sigma^2_{input} = \sigma^2 \cdot \mathcal{S}^2 + \sigma^2_{ice},
\end{equation}
where $\sigma^2 $ is the firn diffusion. For both case A and B, the ice diffusion is $\sigma_{ice} = 10^{-3}\,\mathrm{m}$ with a thinning of $\mathcal{S} = 0.80$.
Sampling with a discrete scheme of $\Delta = 0.025\, \mathrm{m}$ and 
addition of white measurement noise completes the process
of the time series generation. We use a noise level of $0.05\,\permil, \,0.07\,\permil$ and $0.5\,\permil$ 
for \delOxb, \delOx~and \delD~respectively, with the numbers 
being representative of measurement noise we have been 
observing over years of ice core measurements in our laboratory.

For a case B scenario, the sampled outputs of the synthetic data before and after diffusion is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:appendix_synthetic_data}.
Applying the forward-diffusion smoothens the large amplitudes of the high frequencies. 
This effect is further illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:appendix_synthetic_PSD} which shows the PSD of the signal before and after diffusion.

\section{Discrete sampling diffusion} \label{sec:appendix_sampling_diffusion}
The sample diffusion length $\sigma_{\mathrm{dis}}$ is estimated by setting the transfer function of a Gaussian filter 
equal to a rectangular filter with width of the sample size $\Delta$.
The transfer function for the Gaussian filter in Eq. \ref{eq.gaussian} is found by its Fourier transform:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Gaussian_filter}
\mathfrak{F}\left[\mathcal{G}\right] = \hat{\mathcal{G}} = e^{-\frac{k^2 \sigma^2_{\mathrm{dis}}}{2}}.    
\end{equation}
A regular rectangle function is defined as:
\begin{equation}
\text{rect(t)}   = \begin{cases} 1 & 	\text{for } -\frac{1}{2} < t < \frac{1}{2} \\
\frac{1}{2} & \text{for }     t = |\frac{1}{2}|   \\
0  & \text{for }     t > |\frac{1}{2}|  %
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
This can be transformed into a rectangular function ($\Pi(t)$) with width $\Delta$ and amplitude A:
\begin{equation}
\Pi(t) = A \cdot \text{rect}(t\cdot\Delta), \indent \text{for } -\frac{\Delta}{2} < t < \frac{\Delta}{2}.
\end{equation}
Normalization yields an amplitude of  $A = 1/\Delta$. The Fourier transformation of the rectangular pulse is written as:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:rectangular}
\hat{\Pi}(f) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \Pi(t) e^{- 2 \pi i f t} \mathrm{d}t = \int_{-\Delta/2}^{\Delta/2} \frac{1}{\Delta} e^{- 2 \pi i f_{\mathrm{Nq}} t} \mathrm{d}t,
\end{equation}
where $f_{\mathrm{Nq}} = 1/(2 \Delta)$ is the Nyquist frequency.
Setting equations \ref{eq:Gaussian_filter} and \ref{eq:rectangular} equal to each other:
\begin{equation}
e^{-\frac{k^2 \sigma^2_{dis}}{2}} =  \int_{-\Delta/2}^{\Delta/2} \frac{1}{\Delta} e^{- 2 \pi i f_{nq} t} \mathrm{d}t,
\end{equation}
where  $k = 2\pi f_{\mathrm{Nq}}$. This results in the following solution for the discrete sampling diffusion length:
\begin{equation}  \label{eq:sample_diff}
\sigma^2_{\mathrm{dis}} = \frac{2\Delta^2}{\pi^2} \ln\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right).
\end{equation}

Here we provide figures that show the performance of each diffusion technique. 
For each data section we have the estimated uncorrected diffusion lengths in a table.
